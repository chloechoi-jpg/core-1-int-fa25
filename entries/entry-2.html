    <p>The Whitney Museum of American Art is recognized internationally for its singular mission to focus exclusively on the art and artists of the United States. Standing apart from many of its contemporaries, the Whitney is the only museum dedicated solely to American art and artists. It serves as a home for discovering the richness and complexity of American art, committed to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting progressive American art while supporting new artists and emerging art forms. Today, the collection contains over 26,000 works created by more than 6,000 artists.</p>

   <p>The museum’s history dates back to the early twentieth century and the vision of sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. She recognized that American artists who embraced new ideas struggled to exhibit or sell their work. Whitney took a bold stand for these overlooked American artists, ultimately becoming a leading patron of American art from 1907 until her death in 1942. In 1914, she established the Whitney Studio in Greenwich Village to present exhibitions by living American artists whose work had been disregarded by traditional academies. By 1929, she had assembled a collection of over five hundred pieces. After the Metropolitan Museum of Art declined her offer to gift this collection, Whitney founded her own institution in 1930, setting the distinctive mandate to focus exclusively on art from this country. The Whitney Museum of American Art first opened its doors in 1931 on West Eighth Street.</p>

   <p>Innovation has been a crucial hallmark of the Whitney since its inception. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists. The museum has secured its fame and influence by consistently exhibiting new works and supporting contemporary artists, often purchasing pieces within the year they were created, well before the artists achieved broad recognition. The Whitney is regarded as a high-profile venue where relatively unknown artists can show their work alongside established masters such as Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Jean-Michel Basquiat.</p>

   <p>The museum has deep holdings across major movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including Abstract Expressionism, Pop art, Minimalism, and contemporary work centered on identity and politics. Furthermore, it was the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik in 1982). Important figures, including Cindy Sherman, Jasper Johns, Glenn Ligon, and Paul Thek, were given their first comprehensive museum surveys at the Whitney.</p>

   <p>The museum’s most famous platform for charting the direction of contemporary art is the Whitney Biennial, which is the longest-running series of exhibitions to survey recent developments in American art. Introduced by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in 1932, this signature exhibition is where artists test boundaries, spark conversation, and ultimately shape culture. The institution also provides a "safe haven" for young and emerging artists, students, and theorists to study and develop their crafts.</p>

   <p>The Whitney's move to its current location in the vibrant Meatpacking District in 2015 significantly enhanced its role and physical presence in New York City. The new building, designed by architect Renzo Piano, is situated between the High Line and the Hudson River. This move was widely anticipated, with the project being cited as one that would help reshape New York City.</p>
<p>The Renzo Piano-designed structure vastly increased the museum’s exhibition and programming capacity, providing the most expansive display ever of its collection of modern and contemporary American art. The building features approximately 50,000 square feet of indoor galleries, including a special exhibitions gallery (about 18,000 square feet) that is the largest column-free museum gallery in New York City. Additionally, the building includes 13,000 square feet of outdoor exhibition space and terraces that offer sweeping skyline views of landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. The Whitney engages directly with the bustling community of artists, galleries, educators, and residents in the Meatpacking District, Chelsea, and Greenwich Village, and maintains accessibility through robust free and discounted offerings, such as Free Friday Nights and Free Second Sundays.</p>

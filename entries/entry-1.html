   <p>The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues on 53rd Street, stands as one of the world’s most influential and largest modern art museums. Often referred to simply as MoMA, this landmark is currently one of the most visited art museums globally. The museum's founding director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., intended MoMA to be dedicated to helping people understand and enjoy the visual arts of our time, aiming to provide New York with “the greatest museum of modern art in the world”. Today, MoMA is regarded as having the best collection of modern masterpieces in the world that define Western culture.</p>

  <h1>History</h1>
</header>
   
   <img src="../images/image-3.webp" />
   <p>The history of MoMA began in the late 1920s when three progressive and influential patrons of the arts—Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan—sought to challenge the conservative policies of traditional museums by establishing an institution devoted exclusively to modern art. Abby Rockefeller conceived the idea in 1929. Despite initial heavy opposition and refusal of support from her husband, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., the museum opened to the public for the first time on November 7, 1929, just days after the devastating Wall Street Crash. The museum rented modest quarters in the Heckscher Building. A. Conger Goodyear was invited by Abby Rockefeller to become the new museum’s president, and Alfred H. Barr, Jr. was recruited as the founding director</p>

   <p>Due to overwhelmingly enthusiastic public response, the museum moved three times over the next decade into progressively larger temporary quarters. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. eventually became a benefactor and donated the land on 53rd Street for the permanent home. The permanent Museum of Modern Art structure opened on May 10, 1939.</p>

   <p>MoMA achieved its fame and influence in the art world through its comprehensive, pioneering collection and innovative structure. Upon his appointment, Alfred H. Barr, Jr. submitted an innovative plan that resulted in a multi-departmental structure based on varied forms of visual expression. Barr was key to the museum’s expansionism, notably bringing displayed paintings by artists like Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and Vincent van Gogh. MoMA was America’s premier museum dedicated strictly to modern art and was the first of its kind to host modern European influences as an exhibit. Significantly, MoMA founded the first museum department in the world dedicated to architecture and design in 1932. Barr also stressed the importance of bringing "great and peculiar art forms," including film works, to public attention. The film department’s success led to its commendation in 1937 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its significant work in collecting films for public viewing. Today, MoMA’s collection, which started with an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing, comprises approximately 200,000 works, including paintings, sculptures, drawings, and films.</p>

   <p>MoMA’s impact on global art interpretation was cemented by landmark exhibitions. The display of Vincent van Gogh’s artwork in 1935 won huge public approval and spiked the museum’s popularity rating. Later, the display of Pablo Picasso’s artwork from 1939 to 1940 earned international recognition and contributed to Picasso becoming one of the most iconic artists of all time. Furthermore, the 1941 exhibition Indian Art of the United States changed the way Native American art was viewed by the public and displayed in other art museums. Beyond exhibitions, the MoMA Library and Archives contain the leading concentration of research material on modern art in the world, including over 320,000 items and files on more than 90,000 artists.</p>

   <h1>Connection to NYC</h1>
<img src="../images/FHD_Recursos_museu_MoMa.jpg" />
   <p>The institution’s impact on New York City is evident through its continuous physical growth and dedication to public education. Located in Midtown Manhattan, the museum doubled its gallery size by 1983 and added the fifty-six-story Museum Tower. A major expansion completed in 2004, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, cost $858 million and nearly doubled the space to 630,000 square feet. Further renovations, completed in 2019, increased the overall floor size to 708,000 square feet. MoMA is dedicated to its role as an educational institution, providing a complete program of activities, including gallery talks, lectures, and workshops, to assist both the general public and specialized segments of the community in understanding modern and contemporary art. The museum also formalized an affiliation with the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) in 2000, which expands outreach and collaborative opportunities in collections, exhibitions, and educational programs. MoMA and MoMA PS1 welcome millions of visitors every year, serving a still larger public through national and international programs and circulating exhibitions.</p>

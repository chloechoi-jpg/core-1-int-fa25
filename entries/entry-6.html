<body>
   <p>The MET Cloisters is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, dedicated exclusively to the art, architecture, and gardens of medieval Europe. Located in Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, the museum is designed to resemble a medieval European monastery, incorporating elements from five actual cloisters transported from France, Spain, and other parts of Europe. Its collection spans from the early Middle Ages to the late Gothic period, featuring illuminated manuscripts, sculptures, metalwork, textiles, and stained glass, all carefully curated to immerse visitors in the cultural and spiritual life of the medieval era. The building itself, with its stone walls, arched walkways, and peaceful gardens, provides a contemplative atmosphere that echoes the monastic environments it replicates.</p>

  <h1>History</h1>
</header>
   
   <img src="../images/image-22.avif" />
   <p>The history of the MET Cloisters dates back to the early 20th century, when art historian and collector George Grey Barnard amassed a vast collection of medieval art. Barnard’s collection, along with his vision of creating a space dedicated to medieval European culture, caught the attention of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which acquired the collection in 1925. The museum was subsequently constructed between 1934 and 1938, funded by philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., who donated the land in Fort Tryon Park and supported the building’s design. Over the decades, the Cloisters has continued to expand its collection and maintain its historical integrity, offering both scholars and the public an authentic medieval experience in the heart of New York City.</p>

   <p>The MET Cloisters is significant to New York City for several reasons. Culturally, it serves as a unique repository of European medieval art, giving New Yorkers and international visitors access to a period often underrepresented in the United States. Architecturally, it stands out as a serene and historically resonant landmark amid the bustling city, offering a rare space of tranquility and reflection. Additionally, its location in Fort Tryon Park connects art with nature, making it an integral part of the city’s cultural and recreational landscape. The Cloisters also plays an educational role, hosting lectures, workshops, and exhibitions that deepen public understanding of medieval history and art, cementing its reputation as one of New York City’s most distinctive and treasured museums.</p>
